# J1SPA: Data-Driven Business Analytics & Decision Support System

Web application for **J1 Scooter Parts and Accessories**: direct sales entry, stock-in,
product management, manual service records, an owner analytics dashboard, five-model
demand forecasting, and a rule-based decision-support layer — all behind one
role-gated interface (owner / staff).

Hosted on the public internet (Vercel + Supabase), reachable from anywhere, not just
on-site.

## 1. Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Web app | Next.js 16 (App Router, plain JavaScript — not TypeScript, a deliberate Phase 0 choice) |
| Database + Auth | Supabase (Postgres, Row Level Security, Supabase Auth) |
| Hosting | Vercel, deploying `web/` as the project root |
| Forecasting | FastAPI (Python) microservice, `forecast-service/`, deployed separately on Render |
| Email | Resend (password-reset links) |

There is **no ETL/warehouse layer** — the dashboard, forecasting, and decision-support
pages all read live from one operational Postgres schema (`sql/supabase_schema.sql`),
via SQL views (`vw_daily_sales`, `vw_monthly_sales`, `vw_product_velocity`) computed on
the fly rather than a separately-synced star schema.

---

## 2. Roles

* **owner** → full access: dashboard, forecasting, decision support, products, sales
  entry, stock-in, services, settings (staff account management).
* **staff** → sales entry + stock-in only. No cost, gross profit, analytics,
  forecasts, or advisories.

Enforced both at the page level (role check + redirect) and at the database level
(Postgres Row Level Security policies) — not just hidden in the UI.

## 4. Local development

### Web app

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in from Supabase/Resend/Render - see that file
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

### Forecast service

Only needed if you're changing forecasting logic — the deployed one on Render is what
the web app calls by default.

```bash
cd forecast-service
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate              # or source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env                # fill in Supabase service-role key + shared key
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 5. Database

`sql/supabase_schema.sql` is the full from-scratch schema. Every change since the
initial migration has also shipped as its own small, additive migration file
(`sql/supabase_add_*.sql`, `sql/supabase_fix_*.sql`) — safe to run against a live
database with real data, and kept in sync with `supabase_schema.sql` so a fresh setup
and an already-running one stay equivalent. Each file's header comment says what it
depends on, if anything; apply unapplied ones in that order via the Supabase SQL
Editor.

Multi-table writes (`confirm_sale`, `edit_sale`, `undo_sale`, `record_stock_movements`,
`record_service`, `undo_service`) are Postgres RPC functions — `security definer`,
row-locking, atomic — since PostgREST alone can't do a locking multi-statement
transaction in one call.
