-- =====================================================================
--  Fixes a bug in dashboard_gross_net_summary()'s 'year' branch (Gross &
--  Net chart, "Year" tab): same root cause as the edit_sale() bug fixed
--  earlier - the function's `returns table(period_start date, gross
--  numeric, net numeric)` makes period_start/gross/net implicit plpgsql
--  variables throughout the function body. The 'year' branch's outer
--  `select period_start, gross, net from (...) recent` (and the inner
--  subquery's `group by period_start` / `order by period_start desc`)
--  referenced those names bare, which Postgres can't resolve between the
--  plpgsql variable and the subquery's own same-named column - "column
--  reference 'period_start' is ambiguous" (42702) on every 'year' call.
--
--  The day/week/month branches never hit this: they always alias off a
--  qualified source column (days.d as period_start, buckets.bucket_start
--  as period_start, months.m as period_start) and never reference the
--  bare alias afterward, so there's nothing ambiguous to resolve.
--
--  Fix: qualify every reference with the subquery's `recent` alias, and
--  group/order by the actual expression instead of the bare alias.
--  Function signature (name, params, return columns) is unchanged, so
--  this is a plain CREATE OR REPLACE - no need to drop first.
--
--  ADDITIVE ONLY - safe to run with real data. Run in a NEW query tab.
--  Also mirrored into sql/supabase_schema.sql and
--  sql/supabase_fix_gross_net_windows.sql.
