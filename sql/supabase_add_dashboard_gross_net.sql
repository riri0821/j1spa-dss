--  Adds the function backing the Dashboard's Gross & Net chart, which
--  replaces the old Sales Volume Heatmap. Combines sales (revenue has
--  a cost, so net = revenue - cost) and services (manual entry, no
--  cost tracked, so net = gross for that row) into one per-period
--  timeline, grouped by day/week/month/year.
--
--  ADDITIVE ONLY - safe to run against real data. Run in a NEW SQL
--  Editor query tab. Mirrors sql/supabase_schema.sql, which stays the
--  source of truth for a from-scratch setup - keep them in sync if you
--  change either. Depends on sql/supabase_add_services.sql already
--  having been run (needs the services table).
