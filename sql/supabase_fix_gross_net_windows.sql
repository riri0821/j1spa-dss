-- =====================================================================
--  Behavior change (not a bug): dashboard_gross_net_summary() used to take
--  the "most recent N periods that have at least one transaction" for every
--  granularity - so "Day" could quietly skip a day with zero sales and
--  reach further back to compensate, and "Month" was a rolling 12-month
--  window that crossed year boundaries (e.g. "Nov 25 -> Oct 26") instead of
--  reading as "this year."
--
--  New windows, one fixed calendar range per granularity, zero-filled so a
--  no-sales period still shows as a $0 bar instead of silently vanishing:
--    day   - the last 30 calendar days through today
--    week  - this calendar month only, cut into fixed 7-day chunks
--            (days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29-end) rather than Mon-Sun
--            ISO weeks, which would spill into the neighboring month at
--            the edges
--    month - Jan 1 of this year through the current month
--    year  - unchanged: most recent p_periods years that have data
--
--  p_periods is now only read by the 'year' branch; day/week/month ignore
--  it since their windows are fixed by the calendar, not a row count.
--
--  ADDITIVE ONLY - safe to run with real data. Run in a NEW query tab.
--  Also mirrored into sql/supabase_schema.sql.
