"""FastAPI entrypoint. Kept as a standalone Python service (not ported to
Node) because the forecasting math (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, scikit-learn
linear regression) has no equivalent JS library with the same fidelity -
see the PERN migration plan. Only the Next.js backend calls this (with
FORECAST_SERVICE_KEY, never exposed to the browser), so it doesn't
duplicate the app's own login - it trusts whoever holds that key."""
